## **ðŸ“Œ Step-by-Step Development Plan**

### **ðŸš€ Phase 1: RTSP Stream Handling & Live Viewing**
ðŸ”¹ **Goal:** Set up GStreamer-based RTSP streaming and serve it in a Web UI.

#### **Step 1: Set Up a GStreamer RTSP Pipeline**
1. Install GStreamer and necessary plugins.
2. Test the RTSP stream from a camera using GStreamer CLI.
3. Convert RTSP to MJPEG or HLS for browser compatibility.

#### **Step 2: Implement RTSP Streaming in Python**
1. Create a Python service using GStreamer to fetch RTSP streams.
2. Ensure auto-reconnect and buffering optimization.
3. Integrate WebSockets or HTTP streaming for live video.

#### **Step 3: Create a FastAPI Backend to Serve Streams**
1. Set up FastAPI as the main backend service.
2. Develop an endpoint to serve live video streams.
3. Implement WebSockets for real-time streaming.

#### **Step 4: Build a Simple React Web UI**
1. Use `react-player` or `video.js` for streaming.
2. Create a dashboard to view live camera feeds.
3. Connect the frontend to FastAPI for fetching streams.

### **ðŸ“Œ Phase 2: Motion Detection & Event Handling**
ðŸ”¹ **Goal:** Implement real-time motion detection and event logging.

#### **Step 5: Extract Frames from GStreamer**
1. Modify the pipeline to send frames to OpenCV.
2. Implement an efficient frame buffer.

#### **Step 6: Implement Motion Detection with OpenCV**
1. Use background subtraction or AI-based motion detection.
2. Tune sensitivity and filtering to reduce false positives.

#### **Step 7: Send Motion Events to the API**
1. Implement an API endpoint to log motion events.
2. Store events in a database with timestamps and camera IDs.

---

### **ðŸ“Œ Phase 3: Video Recording & Storage**
ðŸ”¹ **Goal:** Record video clips based on motion events.

#### **Step 8: Set Up Video Recording in GStreamer**
1. Configure pipelines for event-based and continuous recording.
2. Optimize encoding settings for performance and storage.

#### **Step 9: Implement Motion-Triggered Recording**
1. Trigger recording when motion is detected.
2. Save video files with timestamp-based naming.

#### **Step 10: Store Event Metadata in PostgreSQL**
1. Design a schema for motion events and recording logs.
2. Implement database queries to fetch event-based recordings.

---

### **ðŸ“Œ Phase 4: Configuration, UI & Optimization**
ðŸ”¹ **Goal:** Make the system configurable & optimize performance.

#### **Step 11: Add API for Camera Configuration**
1. Create database tables for camera configurations.
2. Develop a FastAPI CRUD API for managing cameras.

#### **Step 12: Improve Web UI**
1. Add configuration options for motion detection and recording.
2. Implement event logs and recording playback.

#### **Step 13: Optimize for Performance**
1. Enable GPU acceleration for encoding and processing.
2. Implement auto-reconnect on RTSP stream failure.
3. Optimize storage with retention policies.

---

### **Final Steps**
âœ… **Test each module separately.**  
âœ… **Deploy using Docker for modularity.**  
âœ… **Implement authentication and security.**  

## **ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps**
- Start with **Phase 1: RTSP Stream Handling** and build iteratively.
- Test and refine motion detection before moving to recording.
- Continuously improve and optimize based on testing feedback.
